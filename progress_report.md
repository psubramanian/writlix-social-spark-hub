# Project Progress Report - Writlix Social Spark Hub

This document summarizes the key development, refactoring, and cleanup tasks completed for the Writlix Social Spark Hub application (frontend and backend).

## I. Core Authentication Implementation (Clerk B2C - Full Stack)

- **Initial Clerk Integration (Frontend & Backend):** Successfully integrated Clerk as the primary identity provider for B2C authentication across the stack.
  - **Frontend:** Setup Clerk React SDK, environment variables, and UI components for login/signup.
  - **Backend:** Configured Clerk backend SDK for token verification, user data synchronization (e.g., via webhooks to a backend database if applicable), and secure API endpoint protection.
- **Passwordless OTP Login:** Implemented a secure and user-friendly passwordless login flow using One-Time Passwords (OTP). This method allows users to sign in or sign up using a code sent to their email or phone, removing the need for traditional passwords.
- **Protected Routes & API Endpoints:**
  - **Frontend:** Established protected routes using Clerk's authentication state.
  - **Backend:** Secured API endpoints by verifying Clerk-issued JWTs, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- **Session Management:** Clerk now manages user sessions, authentication tokens, and provides mechanisms for session validation on both client and server.
- **Foundation for Further Refactoring:** This core Clerk setup provided the necessary foundation for systematically migrating all legacy Supabase authentication mechanisms to Clerk across the entire application.

## II. Frontend Refactoring and Cleanup Initiatives

### 1. Legacy Authentication Migration (Eliminating `getCurrentUser`)
The primary objective following the core Clerk setup was to migrate from the legacy Supabase `getCurrentUser` utility to Clerk for all frontend authentication needs.

- **Hooks Refactored:**
  - All hooks previously using `getCurrentUser` were modified to accept `userId: string | undefined` as a parameter (derived from Clerk's `useUser` hook). This includes:
    - `useSocialPosting.ts`
    - `usePostContent.ts`
    - `usePostOperations.ts`
    - `useScheduleSettings.ts`
    - `usePostScheduling.ts`
    - `useScheduledPostsFetch.ts`
    - `useDashboardStats.ts`
- **Components/Pages Refactored:**
  - Components and pages were updated to use Clerk's `useUser()` hook directly or to pass the `userId` to the refactored hooks.
    - `useScheduledPosts.ts` (now uses `useUser` internally)
    - `src/components/dashboard/UpcomingPosts.tsx`
    - `src/pages/PublishedContent.tsx`
- **Caller Components Updated:**
  - Ensured that components calling these refactored hooks now pass the Clerk `user?.id`:
    - `src/pages/Schedule.tsx` (updated for `useScheduleSettings`)
    - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (updated for `useDashboardStats`)
- **Legacy Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed exports of `getCurrentUser` from `src/utils/auth/index.ts` and `src/utils/supabaseUserUtils.ts`.
  - The file `src/utils/auth/getCurrentUser.ts` is now effectively dead code and pending manual deletion.

### 2. Sidebar Feature Gating Simplification
- The existing client-side feature gating logic in `Sidebar.tsx` (which used a `premium` flag on menu items and checked `hasActiveSubscription`) was completely removed.
- This allows unrestricted navigation via the sidebar, in preparation for a new, robust gating system potentially managed by Clerk's roles/permissions or a dedicated subscription service (e.g., Stripe), likely involving backend logic.

### 3. Dependency Cleanup: `lovable-dev[bot]` / `lovable-tagger`
- Identified and removed the `lovable-tagger` development dependency from the frontend.
  - Removed from `devDependencies` in `frontend/package.json`.
  - Uninstalled the package using `npm uninstall lovable-tagger`.
  - Removed the import and usage of `componentTagger` from `frontend/vite.config.ts`.
- The frontend project is now free of this dependency and related code references.

### 4. Legacy Subscription-Based Route Protection Removal
- Investigated the `SubscriptionProtectedRoute.tsx` component, which was used to protect frontend routes based on subscription status via the `useSubscription` hook.
- Removed all usages of `SubscriptionProtectedRoute` from `frontend/src/App.tsx`. The protected routes (`/data-seed` and `/instant-post`) are now only guarded by the general Clerk authentication check (`ProtectedRoute`).
- The file `frontend/src/components/routes/SubscriptionProtectedRoute.tsx` is now effectively dead code and pending manual deletion.
- The `useSubscription` hook remains in use by other frontend components (`Sidebar.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, `Subscription.tsx`, etc.) for displaying subscription status and managing the subscription page, and has not been removed.

## III. Next Steps and Future Considerations (Full Stack)

- **Implement New Feature Gating (Full Stack):** Design and implement a new feature gating system using Clerk's capabilities (e.g., roles, permissions, custom session claims) and integrate with backend logic for enforcement and subscription management (e.g., Stripe webhooks, database flags).
- **Manual Deletion of Dead Code (Frontend):**
  - `frontend/src/utils/auth/getCurrentUser.ts`
  - `frontend/src/components/routes/SubscriptionProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Backend Refactoring:** Identify and refactor any backend services or logic still dependent on legacy Supabase authentication or user IDs.
- **Thorough Testing (Full Stack):** Conduct comprehensive testing of all authentication flows, API endpoints, refactored components, and user pathways across both frontend and backend.
- **`useSubscription` Hook Review (Frontend):** Evaluate and potentially refactor or replace the `useSubscription` hook and its dependent components once the new Clerk-based subscription management and gating system is fully in place.
- **Profile Completion Logic (Full Stack):** Review and integrate profile completion logic with Clerk's user object and session management, ensuring data synchronization between frontend and backend if necessary.
