## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### From Supabase to AWS

**Current Architecture:**
- Supabase Auth + Database + Edge Functions
- ~$100-150/month costs
- Limited customization options

**Target AWS Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** S3 Static Hosting + CloudFront CDN
- **Authentication:** Clerk (B2C + OAuth)
- **Compute:** AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
- **Database:** RDS PostgreSQL (optimized schema)
- **Storage:** S3 (AI-generated images + static assets)
- **API:** API Gateway (REST endpoints)
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch (logs + metrics)

### Key Integrations Preserved
- ✅ OpenAI (GPT-4o content generation)
- ✅ Social Media APIs (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- ✅ Stripe (payment processing)
- ✅ Google reCAPTCHA (security)
