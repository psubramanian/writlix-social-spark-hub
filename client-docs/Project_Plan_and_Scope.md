# Project Plan & Scope
## Writlix AWS Migration & Modernization

**Project:** Supabase to AWS Migration  
**Timeline:** 2-3 Weeks  
**Budget:** $500 + AWS Infrastructure Costs  
**Goal:** Cost-effective, scalable AWS architecture under $100/month  

---

## Executive Summary

Writlix Social Spark Hub is migrating from Supabase to AWS to achieve better cost control, scalability, and reliability. This migration will modernize the authentication system with Clerk, optimize the database schema, and implement a serverless architecture that scales with growth while maintaining costs under $100/month.

### Key Benefits
- **Cost Reduction:** 40-60% reduction in monthly backend costs
- **Enhanced Security:** Clerk's enterprise-grade authentication
- **Improved Scalability:** AWS auto-scaling capabilities
- **Better Performance:** Optimized database and serverless functions
- **Vendor Independence:** Reduced lock-in with industry-standard AWS services

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Supabase Setup
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with OAuth (Google, LinkedIn)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with 12+ tables for users, content, social credentials
- **Edge Functions:** 15 functions handling OAuth, content generation, and social posting
- **Storage:** Profile images and temporary uploads
- **External Integrations:** OpenAI, Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn APIs, Stripe

### Pain Points Being Addressed
1. **High Costs:** Supabase pricing scaling beyond budget
2. **Vendor Lock-in:** Proprietary edge function platform
3. **Limited Control:** Restricted customization options
4. **Complex Auth:** Custom authentication flows with recovery mechanisms

- **Amazon S3:** Object storage for images and user-generated assets
- **Benefits:** Automated backups, security, cost-effective storage tiers

**Monitoring & Security**
- **CloudWatch:** Logging and monitoring
- **IAM:** Fine-grained access control
- **Benefits:** Comprehensive observability, enterprise-grade security

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)
**Infrastructure Preparation**
- AWS account setup and IAM configuration
- RDS PostgreSQL instance provisioning (db.t3.micro for cost optimization)
- S3 buckets creation (frontend hosting + asset storage) with lifecycle policies
- CloudFront CDN distribution setup for global performance
- API Gateway configuration with CORS and authentication

**Authentication Migration**
- Clerk account setup and configuration
- OAuth provider setup (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)
- Webhook configuration for user event handling
- Frontend integration with Clerk React SDK

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ AWS infrastructure provisioned
- ✅ Clerk authentication functional
- ✅ Basic user login/logout working

### Phase 2: Data & Function Migration (Week 2)
**Database Migration**
- Schema optimization and cleanup
- Data export from Supabase
- Secure data import to RDS
- User ID mapping between Clerk and legacy system

**Lambda Function Development**
- Convert 15 Supabase Edge Functions to AWS Lambda
- API Gateway endpoint configuration
- Environment variable management
- Error handling and logging implementation

**Critical Functions:**
1. OAuth callback handlers (4 functions)
2. Content generation (2 functions)
3. Social media posting (6 functions)
4. Stripe subscription management (2 functions)
5. Utility functions (1 function)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Database migrated with optimized schema
- ✅ All Lambda functions deployed and tested
- ✅ API endpoints functional

### Phase 3: Integration & Optimization (Week 3)
**Frontend Updates**
- Update API endpoints to AWS Gateway
- Deploy React SPA to S3 with CloudFront CDN
- Implement Clerk session management
- Configure build process for static hosting
- Error handling and user feedback

**Testing & Optimization**
- End-to-end functionality testing
- Performance optimization
- Cost monitoring setup
- Security audit and hardening

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Full application functionality restored
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ Cost optimization targets achieved

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Optimization
**Tables to Eliminate (Clerk handles):**
- `profiles` → Clerk user metadata
- Auth-related tables → Clerk authentication

**Essential Tables to Migrate:**
- `content_ideas` (generated content storage)
- `scheduled_posts` (posting schedule management)
- `user_*_credentials` (social media tokens)
- `user_subscriptions` (payment status)
- `schedule_settings` (user preferences)

**Storage Reduction:** ~40% reduction in database size

### Lambda Function Architecture
**Function Categories:**
1. **Auth Functions:** OAuth callback processing
2. **Content Functions:** AI-powered content generation
3. **Posting Functions:** Social media API integration
4. **Utility Functions:** Payments, scheduling, validation

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Cold start reduction with provisioned concurrency for critical functions
- Memory optimization (128MB-512MB based on function needs)
- Connection pooling for database access
- Efficient error handling and retry logic

### Cost Optimization Strategy
**Free Tier Maximization:**
- Lambda: 1 million requests/month free
- RDS: 750 hours/month free (db.t2.micro/db.t3.micro)
- S3: 5GB storage + 20,000 GET requests free
- API Gateway: 1 million requests/month free

**Ongoing Cost Management:**
- CloudWatch budgets and alerts
- S3 lifecycle policies for old data
- Lambda memory and timeout optimization
- RDS right-sizing based on usage
